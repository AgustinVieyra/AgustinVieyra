<H3> Hello there 👋 </H3>

Hi, I’m @AgustinVieyra, one of a kind Mathematician who loves being creative and problem solving in all type of fields: mathematics, science, design,  business, etc. I specialize in math modeling, using that ability for the last 5 years in Statistics and Big Data.

- 👀 My interests are very varied. I am a little of a renaissance man who loves taking deep dives in many types of topics and activities. Writing and drawing are definitely one of my passions, love creating. Solving an interesting math problem (specially doing math modeling), taking a walk talking with friends and reading are also high in the list. I love reading EVERYTHING. I love reading all types of novels, but I also like to read academical and non-fiction on psychology, philosophy, mathematics, history, ethology, economy, art, chemistry and design. I definitely love to learn, apply my knowledge and help others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about implementation of Machine Learning for MLOps.
- 📓 I'm proficient in Python, SQL and Matlab. Also, I'm a big fan of doing small statistics projects in Desmos.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects for enterprises, and any type of eco-ethical project.
- 📫 The best way to cold reach me would be my mail: nt703849@iteso.mx
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently reading this book called "The Choice" by Edith Eger and with just 40 pages read it has become one of my top 5 favourite books ever. I want to order many copies and share them with everyone.
