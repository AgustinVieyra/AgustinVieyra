<H2> Hello there 👋 </H2>

Hi, I’m @AgustinVieyra, one of a kind Mathematician who loves being creative and problem solving in all type of fields: mathematics, science, design,  business, etc. I specialize in mathematical modeling, using that ability since 2018 for Statistics and Big Data.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning about implementation of Machine Learning for MLOps.
- 📓 I'm proficient in Python, SQL (using dbt), Matlab and Tableau. Also, I'm a big fan of doing small statistics projects in Desmos, and worked with R and C aswell.
- 👀 My interests are very varied. I am a little of a renaissance man who loves taking deep dives in many types of topics and activities. Writing and drawing are definitely one of my passions, love creating. Solving an interesting math problems (specially doing math modeling), taking a walk talking with friends and reading are also high in the list. *I love reading EVERYTHING.* I love reading all types of novels, but I also like to read academical and non-fiction on psychology, philosophy, entrepreneurship, mathematics, history, ethology, economy, art, chemistry and design. I definitely love to learn, apply my knowledge and help others.
